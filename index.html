    <h1>CAUSES OF TEENAGE PRENANCY.</h1>
        <p>The US teen birth rate <em>(births per 1,000 females aged 15 to 19 years)</em> has been declining since 1991.  Teen birth rates continued to decline from 17.4 per 1,000 females in 2018 to 16.7 per 1,000 females in 2019.  This is another record low for US teens and a decrease of 4% from 2018.1,2 Birth rates fell 7% for females aged 15 to 17 years and 4% for females aged 18 to 19 years. 
            Although reasons for the declines are not totally clear, evidence suggests these declines are due to more teens abstaining from sexual activity, and more teens who are sexually active using birth control than in previous years.3, 4
            Still, the US teen birth rate is substantially higher than in other western industrialized nations,5 and racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in teen birth rates persist.
